It was acquired by King Francis I of France in the early 16th century and has been owned by the French State ever since. It is displayed at the Louvre Museum in Paris, being undoubtedly the jewel of its collections. Its name, the Mona Lisa, derives from the most accepted thesis about the identity of the model: the wife of Francesco Bartolomeo de Giocondo, who was actually named Lisa Gherardini, hence her other name: Mona (lady, in old Italian) Lisa. The Louvre Museum accepts the full title indicated at the beginning as the original title of the work, although it does not recognize the identity of the model and only accepts it as a hypothesis.");

An inventory from 1499, which was not discovered until 1975, lists the property of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco and his brother Giovanni and allows us to affirm that in the 15th century, La Primavera was on a \"divan\" in an anteroom adjacent to Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco's rooms in the city of Florence.
